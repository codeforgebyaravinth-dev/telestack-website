The TeleStack Website features the main TeleStack platform website, including our [homepage](https://telestack.dev), [docs](https://telestack.dev/docs), and blog.

**TeleStack** is a unified, privacy-first platform merging multiple open-source technologies to provide a complete backend solution for modern applications with authentication, databases, storage, real-time communication, video/audio conferencing, and federated messaging.

The TeleStack Website has been built with the following frameworks:

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)

## Development

_If this is your first time setting up the repository, please run `bun install` inside the repo's directory and create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`._

To get the repo up and running in your local environment, use the following command:

```bash
bun run dev
```

> If you don't have `bun` available on your system, you can install it from the [official Bun Installation website](https://bun.com/docs/installation)
